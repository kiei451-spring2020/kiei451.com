    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>Continue the "Weathernator" application we started during lab; deliver a complete weather application using the WeatherAPI.com API as a source for weather data.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Use the code from lab as your starting point (a solution was provided in class, if you'd like to start there). Create a new repository in your own GitHub account called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">hw5</span>, a HTML file called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">week5.html</span> and a JS file called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">week5.js</span>. Clone this repository to your computer and start from there.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Rubric</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>(1 point) Write the recipe (algorithm) for the approach you're taking in the comments. As previously discussed, it is highly recommended you do this first, then write the code.
        <li>(2 points) Accept a number of days from the end-user, in addition to the free-text location done during lab. Use these two inputs (along with your WeatherAPI.com API key) to retrieve JSON data from WeatherAPI.com.</li>
        <li>(2 points) Display the current weather conditions for the given location – display the parsed location (city and state/region), current temperature, and current conditions (e.g. "partly cloudy").</li>
        <li>(4 points) Using a for-loop and what you know about manipulating the DOM, display a daily forecast. For the number of days provided by the end-user, display the weather forecast; e.g. if the end-user asks for 2 days, show a 2-day forecast. Each day of the forecast should show (at a minimum) the date, high and low temperature, and a summary of the conditions (e.g. "partly cloudy") for each day. <em>Note: the free WeatherAPI.com plan only offers up to a 3 day forecast; so in testing, you can try 1, 2, or 3 days. However, your code should accommodate any number of days provided.</em></li>
        <li>(1 point) In the HTML file, delete the hard-coded HTML provided as examples. You should be left with two empty DIVs for <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">current</span> and <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">forecast</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Guidelines for Submission</h3>
      <p>Your finished product should live in your GitHub account at <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">https://github.com/&lt;your GitHub username&gt;/hw5</span>, and <strong>this URL should be submitted as the "website URL" for this assignment in Canvas.</strong></p>
